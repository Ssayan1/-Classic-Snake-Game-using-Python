# 🐍 Classic Snake Game using Python (Turtle Graphics)

A fun recreation of the classic Snake Game using Python's built-in Turtle Graphics module. This game demonstrates basic **Object-Oriented Programming**, **collision detection**, and **real-time input handling**.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

- Control the snake using **arrow keys**
- Eat food to grow longer 🥚
- Avoid hitting the wall or yourself ❌
- Score increases with each successful bite
- Simple yet clean UI and mechanics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Turtle Graphics module**
- **OOP principles** (`Classes` and `Methods`)

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
## Navigate to the project directory:
cd snake-game
## Run the game:
python main.py
## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned:
Real-time game loop control using screen.tracer(0) and screen.update()

Class-based design for modular code

Keyboard event handling using onkey() and listen()

Collision detection using .distance() method

Basic game physics and logic structuring
